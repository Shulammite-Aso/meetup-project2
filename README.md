# meetup project
This is a project from DSC imsu. The project is still very much at work, but i had to use it to practice working with git and github, as i learn from Learn Enough™ Git to Be
Dangerous at (https://www.learnenough.com/git-tutorial).
This is the very first work i have pushed to github and i"m supper excited about it. Thanks to learnenough.com.
There are a lot to gain from learnenough, why not give it a try. After finishing *Learn Enough™ Git to Be Dangerous*, you'll know enough Git
to be *dangerous*. This means you'll be able to use Git to track changes in
your projects, back up data, share your work with others, and collaborate
with programmers and other users of Git.
